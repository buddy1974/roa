Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like. Live each day as it were your last. We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change&lt;/p&gt;
