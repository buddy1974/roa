<p> [modal_box button style="" target="not-playing-politics"]Read more[/modal_box][modal_box content target="not-playing-politics" style=""]Fellow Ambazonians (Southern Cameroonians);</p>
<p><span><span><span>The entire political culture as </span></span></span><span><span><span>sociated with the name Southern Cameroons has never understood what is really at stake here and our people deserve to know the TRUTH. </span></span></span>If not then we certainly deserve the condescendingly nasty appellation that our masters, the Francophone Camerounese have been calling us: “<span>ANGLOFOOLS</span>”</p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The facts of the law listed below are what will enable us survive as a sovereign state that is aware of its RIGHTS and is on the path to independence, </span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>and not as some distinct people inside the Republic of Cameroun:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>Law 84/01 dissolved the Union of Southern Cameroons &amp; Republic of Cameroun.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Cameroun High Court Judgment HCB/28/92 declared that Cameroun’s occupation of Ambazonia was an act of continuing aggression and ordered that Cameroun withdraw from Ambazonia.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>United Nations ICCPR/1134/2002 judgment confirmed that;</span></span></span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>our country is AMBAZONIA and not the southern part of Cameroun</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Ambazonia is sovereign &amp; independent of Cameroun but has been under subjugation by Franco-Cameroun armed forces</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Cameroun’s occupation of Ambazonia has forced its leader into exile and he has been unable to exercise his right to freely go in and out of his country without fear</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Cameroun must provide an effective remedy to this situation, i.e., put an end to its occupation of Ambazonia</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><span>We as the several distinctive units of peoples (Bakossi, Bakweri, Bali, Banso, Kenyang, etc, etc,) were by virtue of our histo-sociological, as well as our political evolution fully qualified for our very own distinctive sovereign state, but for the series of horrifying misrepresentation by elites of the Southern Cameroons. It happened with tragic results in the 1950s, 1960s, and like clockwork, it is happening today when these same elites have placed their personal interest above that of our people.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The latest case of such misrepresentation by Mola Njoh Litumbe who as Chairman and founder of LDA has sworn allegiance to uphold the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cameroun and is doing everything possible to distract our people from focusing on the “what is at stake."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>By claiming that the Cameroon federation never existed while at the same time citing “</span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>Cameroun Law No. 90/055 of Dec. 19, 1990.  Section 3(1)” regarding public meetings;</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> he Mola Njoh Litumbe is serving but Cameroun’s best interest.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also, by promoting the Banjul's court decision ACHPR 2003 C-266 of distinct peoples’ right over the UN HRC ICCPR C-1134/2002 decision of sovereignty rights recognition, Mola Njoh Litumbe has just provided conclusive evidence of his role as an agent of the Republic of Cameroun.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Fellow Compatriots, our polity has strayed very far away from the logical path set out by the laws that applies to our case. Therefore the question following Dr. Ayim’s call to rally behind Ambazonia has to be whether all those who are prepared to fight for the independence of our country really know what it means to obey the laws which apply to our case.  That is, the power that would automatically come to us as the sovereign state of Ambazonia. That power is already vested in the UN ICCPR-C1134/20O2 judgment which recognizes Ambazonia as the Successor State of Southern Cameroons following the dissolution of the Cameroon federation by Restoration Law 84/01.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Paragraph 2.5 of <a href="https://ambazonia.org/media/pdfs/UNCCPRC83D11342002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UN ICCPR 1134/2002 judgment</a> clearly reads:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“</span><span><span><span>As a result of the "subjugation" of Ambazonians, whose human rights were allegedly severely violated by members of the Franco-Cameroonian armed forces as well as militia groups, riots broke out in 1983, prompting Parliament to enact Restoration Law 84/01, which dissolved the union of the two countries. The author then became head of the "Ambazonian Restoration Council" and published several articles, which called on President Paul Biya of the Republic of Cameroon to comply with the Restoration Law and to withdraw from Ambazonia</span><span>.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Fellow compatriots:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If we are not willing to take advantage of the </span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>POWERS OF SOVEREIGNTY</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> that comes to us on account of the UN recognition of the Ambazonia and upon Cameroon's own default recognition of Ambazonia, just as it did with the 1992 HCB28/92 judgment, in the 2002 ICCPR 1134/2002 Geneva ruling, then we have to be fully prepared to acquire POWER by other methods. The only other proven method opened to us is to engage Cameroun in an arms struggle!  There can be no two ways around this path: it is the epitome of political opportunism and intellectual dishonesty that, those who are today promoting the Banjul distinct people acquiescence to Cameroun jurisdiction, are the same people who until 2003 have been chastising AMBAZONIA for being all too focused on legalism!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>So why are we reading all these legal stuff about some SCNC entity holding a Human Rights meeting at the Hague, or talking about registering in the UNPO, or filing some case at Abuja, or worse, thinking of filing a case against the non-justifiable United Nations? Are these not all legalese stuff? Or did we miss the memo that granted exemption to these Southern Cameroonians from not be tagged as conducting legalese or lobbying stuff, but just action in the ground stuff?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Have people like Mola Njoh Litumbe who are promoting communication 266/2003 even bordered to read the case of Katangese Peoples’ Congress v. Zaire (Katanga) by the same ACHPR which seals the fate of a distinct peoples’ right? The Commission in this case (paragraph 1) held that self-determination under the ACHPR may only be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire (now DRC). The same ruling applies to Southern Cameroons v. Republic of Cameroun.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You can see the following <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/14/2mhango.pdf?rd=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> for yourself. I do believe that something is fundamentally wrong with some of our leaders and until they abandon this lawlessness and accept the binding force of the law, only then are we able to liberate our country from foreign occupation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><em><span><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></span></em></span></p>

Our elites &amp; intelligentsia, did you hear the chanting?<br /> <br /> Ambazonia Rising, Rising, Rising<br /> Ambazonia Rising to fall no more!<br /> <br /> The youths in the home front have decided to take matters into their own hands by telling the world that they are Ambazonians and NOT Cameroonians.<br /> <br /> It is time for those our elites &amp; intelligentsia who keeps calling themselves Southern Cameroonians (Southern Crayfishes) to follow suit and start calling themselves Ambazonians. Just because the slave/colonial master once called you Crayfish (Njanga) doesn’t mean that you should remain Crayfish. Only someone suffering from a colonial/slave mentality would call him/herself Crayfish just because the colonial/slave master called you Crayfish.</span></span></p>

			<title>Ambazonian Independence Action Plan</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://ambazonia.org/en/blog/180-ambazonian-independence-action-plan</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></p>
<p><span>Here is my plan for more independence for Ambazonia, I hope you like it:</span></p>
<p><span>First, at the UN General Assembly, the already acknowledged nationalist and separatist movement of Southern Cameroons should be officially renamed into Ambazonia Liberation Movement or better Ambaland Nation, because nobody takes a separation movement seriously, if it cannot even separate from the oppressor’s name, and because <strong>land</strong> is sounding more like a full independent land and state and nation than only a zonia or zone in somebody else’s territory</span></p>

			<title>HCB/28/92 Revisited</title>
			<link>https://ambazonia.org/en/blog/171-hcb-28-92-revisited</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://ambazonia.org/en/blog/171-hcb-28-92-revisited</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><span>Case <strong>HCB/28/92: was an Originating summons with an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE</strong></span></p>
<p> <span><strong>Summary (as posted by T before)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>An order to show Cause does not permit the judge to intervene in the process until defendant has filed an affidavit Showing Cause why the judge should intervene and either vary the order or set it aside<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The plaintiff’s process papers containing the Order to Show Cause specifies the number of days within which the defendant must Show Cause. Once the defendant is served with the process, it becomes a Court Judgment Nisi. That is to say, unless the defendant shows justification for the Court to intervene and set it aside or vary it.</span></p>
<p><span>So if the defendant fails to either enter an appearance or if after entering appearance he fails to show cause to justify the intervention of the judge then in that case what the plaintiff has filed automatically becomes a<em> Court judgment absolute;</em> without any act by a judge.</span></p>

			<title>In Defense of Ambazonia (The Name Issue)</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span><strong><br /> Compiled from Links By Justice Muluh Mbuh</strong></span></p>
<address class="western" style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: center; orphans: 2; widows: 2;"><span>(Teacher, Author, Activist)<br /> Secretary General<br /> Ambazonia People's Emancipation Council (APEC)<br /> Washington, DC, USA on this day, March 25, 2005!</span></address><address class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in; orphans: 2; widows: 2;"> </address>
<p><span><strong>In Reaction to a posting on <a href="http://www.postwatchmagazine.com/">www.postwatchmagazine.com</a>,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Merits of the Federal Democratic Republic of Bimbia</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>By the Rt. Hon PP Nkwenti and Reverend J.C. Ngang</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>The Name Issue</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Fon Gorji Dinka once said. “Southern Cameroonians have failed to name themselves so every Tom, Dick, Harry and (Janet) can give them a name." It was on the dire need to banish the borrowed name “Cameroon” from this contentious territory that the Fon dug into the history books and came up with the name AMBAZONIA - the zone beyond Ambas Bay which was itself taken from the word “Amba” a response of the Bota Islanders to the Portuguese sailors when they asked them: What is the name of those flaming mountains? The mountains in question were the Chariot of the Gods. Unfortunately while Ambas Bay exists in the records AMBAZONIA was never codified in International Law.</span></p>
<p><span>Bimbia is present in early International Law. King William of Bimbia executed the first International Treaties between Southern Cameroons and the International Community<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Bimbia was there ages before Southern Cameroons.</span></p>
<p><span><em>By Ntemfac Aloysius Nkong Nchwete Ofege</em></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ofege,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Good work for those coming up with this initiative, however late or timely--which is why this is now suspect, unless those coming up with a new name for Ambazonia Republic (Southern Cameroons) are of genuine spirit in the Ambazonia struggle.<br /> <br /> For that we can question: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>the timeliness of this release. Have these people previously bought into the theory that Ambazonia ought to be christened and not be seen as part of mainland La Republique 'du' Cameroun? (La Republique)! If so, then good, because they may well pass for either confusionists now or outright saboteurs! I hope not, for in a cause where many have been credited with huge sums in their bank accounts for great betrayal jobs, I will not be wrong for suspecting every move by so-called "Southern Cameroonians," especially if they are shooting down the precedence set by the name Ambazonia Republic this soon!</span></li>
<li><span>What do these people have against the name Ambazonia?</span></li>
<li><span>Why use the name of an ethnic group for that of a country when indeed different kings and chief signed different treaties with different colonial masters for that matter?</span></li>
<li><span>The issue of International law is also important--as it also raises some questions, one of which is: while Bimbia goes in as first along the coast of--Ambas Bay?--how does that fit with the fact that the visitors first set foot but on Ambas Bay--Ambas-Zone (Ambazonia)?</span></li>
<li><span>Was the Bimbia Treaty for the peoples of Bimbia or for all of Bimbia's hinterlands? If so, does it leave out its Islands--Ambas Bay Islands?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span><br /> Don't get me wrong, I am simply trying to show that while Bimbia exists in International Law and was indeed one of our first ever signed treaties, it does not make it good a name for our country for the questions asked above, more than Ambazonia does. And even more, Ambas Bay Colony existed with Bimbia as part of it and Victoria it’s Capital. How then do those coming up with this theory defend Bimbia over "The Hinterlands of Ambas Bay"?</span></p>
<p><span>Any way, it is a good debate that makes a distinctive nationality an imperative in the confusion and strangulating decayed polity of Camerounization and I will not be the first person to give it a bad name to hang it, certainly not in place of Cameroun! Any name is better than "Southern Cameroons' or Njanga Water Peopu (Cameroun)! Just by calling for a distinct identity, they have done a great job and if their spirits are genuine, their contributions towards freeing our country from Cameroun recolonization are greeted with joy! Camerounians can eat their varied colored 'Njanga' and remain true Camerounians, not us!</span></p>
<p><span><em>Justice M. Mbuh</em></span></p>
<h2 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;"><span>IMPORTANT HISTORIC REFLECTION:</span></h2>
<p><span>[Saker founded at Ambas Bay a colony of the freed Negroes who then left the island, the settlement being known as Victoria. Two years after this event the first German factory was established in the estuary by Messrs. Woermann of Hamburg. In 1870 the station at Bimbia was given up by the missionaries, but that at Akwa town continued to flourish, the Duala showing themselves eager to acquire education, while Saker reduced their language to writing].</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://89.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CAMEROON.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://89.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CAMEROON.htm</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>SEVEN POINT SUMMARY:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Ambas, Amber--means fertile dark-brown soils, not land of cannibals!</span></li>
<li><span>Ambas is not the same name as 'Tierra Alta de Ambozes' who first set foot on Ambas Bay in 1699!</span></li>
<li><span>Mt. Fako is not Mt. Cameroon: The natives behind the Mt. call it "The native name for the highest part of the mountain is Mongo-ma-Lobah, but at the back or further inland, it is called Mokali-ma-Pako. The isolated peak near the bay, about five thousand feet high, is Mongo-m'Etindeh."</span></li>
<li><span>Ambas Bay and Ambas Bay Colony had international legal status close to becoming an independent country and it did include Bimbia as part of her 'national' Territory!</span></li>
<li><span>It is only logical that all the lands lying behind Ambas Bay as defined by international treaties separating them from Nigeria and Cameroun respectively should be called the Hinterlands of Ambas Bay! --Hence the name Ambazonia Republic! This name change should have happened as soon as Northern Cameroons went into union for absorption by Nigeria so as to prevent Cameroun proper from using her name as a tool to circumvent international law and annex "Ambazonia" illegally and forcefully.</span></li>
<li><span>The name 'Southern Cameroons' should have been banished from our vocabulary as soon as Northern Cameroons went into union with Nigeria. A clear indication that Cameroun was to use her real name to absorb us in violation of sovereign equality doctrine is that they had West Cameroon's government under check, they held us hostage and within six years abolished multipartism, and in another six years abolished our government altogether!</span></li>
<li><span>The use of the name 'Cameroon' to illegally and forcefully annex Ambazonia is as glaring as day light in the name-changing syndrome which Cameroun utilized against our sovereign will and rights; so too is it a necessity as it was equally a powerful tool to use Ambazonia as a distinct identity to counter Cameroun name-changing fever as a threat to our national security!</span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span>Back in 2001 an argument came up on "What's in a name"? Or put more succinctly, what is the meaning of a name? A name can be 'meaningful' only as much as it is used, contextually. In the case of Ambazonia, it is a good thing that elite of the territory has finally arrived in agreement that the territory needs a new name. But rather than go along with what initiated the struggle for independence from Cameroun, some would want to shoot down the name AMBAZONIA for simple reasons that do not serve the best usage and purpose of liberation.</span></p>
<p><span>Some want us to think that the name is tinted because it emanates from the name Tierra Alta de Ambozes, --a Portuguese slave trader in 1699 who visited the area. But Bay of Amboise has never been called Bay of Amboze! Why not? --If it is true that it was name after the slave trader, why avoid his name? Others think the name is another name for cannibals. But these are not true. The Island where Amboze first set foot was already being called Ambas Isle. It was also called Ambas because it was so fertile all one needed to do was throw grains and see them grow and bear a harvest in two to three weeks. Judging that various names have been given even to Mt. Cameroon, which we know is not the right name, how can we denigrate the name or any name without doing similar to the purpose for which it is been used?</span></p>
<p><span>In Webster's English Dictionary, the word Ambash has African origins relating to herbal plants; Amber is also linked to soils--dark brownish, rich soils; so it is even natural to consider Ambas as having to do with rich soils than 'cannibalism'! That is pretty scary, scare-monger or outright attempts at by-passing precedence or sabotage which actions would be inconsistent with accusations against our current illegal occupiers, Cameroun!</span></p>
<p><span>Or should we equally link the name Ambas of California, USA; Ambas of Pakistan; Ambas of Ethiopia; Ambas off France etc, etc, to Cannibalism?</span></p>
<p><span>Or should we accept that the name of Mount Fako is MT Cameroun? A look into the reality of the situation reveals that it is neither Mt. Cameroun nor Mt. Fako. The natives behind the Mt. call it "The native name for the highest part of the mountain is Mongo-ma-Lobah, but at the back or further inland, it is called Mokali-ma-Pako. The isolated peak near the bay, about five thousand feet high, is Mongo-m'Etindeh." Of course, Cameroun authorities would want it to be called Mt. Cameroon; Mt. Cameroun according to Ahidjo's Presidential decrees changing names in Ambazonia to suit Camerounization!</span></p>
<p><span>Others have admitted that Ambas Bay existed long before Bamboo but would prefer Bamboo to Ambazonia--The Hinterlands of Ambas Bay because are they charge, Bimbia is 'codified in international law' while Ambazonia is not! Come to think of it, international law emanates but from customary law--the practice of local peoples over time. Hence, even in this light, Ambas Bay surpasses any short of 'Chariot of Gods ' as a name for our country. Bimbia lies in the hinterlands of Ambas Bay; so too does Victoria; and so does Mr. Fako, or whatever name the locals call it. 'The Hinterlands' theory based on precedence set by Ambas Bay holds water, I suppose as far as liberating the territory from Cameroun goes<b>.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, International Law is a product of domestic, local or Customary Law and so the practices, the customs of our inhabitants of The Hinterlands of Ambas Bay ought to be considered as also constituting international law when names are concerned, not just in terms of treaty significance. Therefore, as far as liberation goes, international law of Ambazonia in the modern era will be based on precedence set by Ambazonia Republic in challenging Cameroun Republic illegal annexation and name-changing syndrome way back in 1984/5. Even before SCAPO was ever born to accept 'legalism' which mainframe. True liberationist should stick with the name Ambazonia and avoid unnecessary arguments and distractions that only delay our freedom. After that, it is a possibility that a name-change could take place down the line. Besides, it was Ambazonia legalism, which others disregarded until SCAPO showed up, that took us far--making our exhaustion of domestic remedies a final thing, as well as igniting fire in the international arena in Washington DC, London, Abuja, Geneva and The Hague. That too is modern international law of our new country being made, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: There are over 150, 000 pages (should we discount those with Bay, etc,) of references on the internet which defend 'AMBAS/AMBER' as having to do with Bays, fertile soils, plains behind bays and mountains, metals and not cannibals!</span></p>
<p><span>Below are some of these references which would justify our current position that we should stay focused with the name Ambazonia which gave us reasons to belief that we could be free from Cameroun recolonization.</span></p>

<p><span>The country is gloriously lovely if one could only see it for the rain and mist; but one only gets dim hints of its beauty when some cold draughts of wind come down from the great mountains and seem to push open the mist-veil as with spirit hands, and then in a minute let it fall together again. I do not expect to reach Buea within regulation time, but at 11.30 my men say “we close in,” and then, coming along a forested hill and down a ravine, we find ourselves facing a rushing river, wherein a squad of black soldiers are washing clothes, with the assistance of a squad of black ladies, with much uproar and sky-larking. I too think it best to wash here, standing in the river and swishing the mud out of my skirts; and then wading across to the other bank, I wring out my skirts. The ground on the further side of the river is cleared of bush, and only bears a heavy crop of balsam; a few steps onwards bring me in view of a corrugated iron-roofed, plank-sided house, in front of which, towards the great mountain which now towers up into the mist, is a low clearing with a quadrangle of native huts — the barracks]].

<p><span>1841: Expedition to Ambas Bay</span></p>
<p><span>A Narrative of the Expedition to the River Niger in 1841 by Captain William Allen, R.N. and T.R.H. Thompson, M.D., Surgeon, R.N. (London, 1848)</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>VOLUME II, CHAPTER IX Bay of Amboises (Ambas Bay)</span></p>
<p><span>The mountainous district, in which the Bay of Amboises is situated, was formerly called by the Portuguese, Tierra Alta de Ambozes, according to Mr. John Grazilhier, who made a voyage to Old Kalabar in 1699. The native name for the highest part of the mountain is Mongo-ma-Lobah, but at the back or further inland, it is called Mokali-ma-Pako. The isolated peak near the bay, about five thousand feet high, is Mongo-m'Etindeh. The summit of the principal mountain, rising thirteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, was often lighted up most brilliantly by the morning sun, while the deep shadows thrown across its base involved all the lower parts in gloom, hiding the deep ravines which furrow its rugged sides....</span></p>

<p><span>The soil up here, about 2,500 feet above sea-level, though rock-laden is exceedingly rich, and the higher we go there is more bergamot, native indigo, with its under leaf dark blue, and lovely coleuses with red markings on their upper leaves, and crimson linings. I, as an ichthyologist, am in the wrong paradise. What a region this would be for a botanist<strong>!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At 7.30 a heavy tornado comes rolling down upon us. Masses of indigo cloud with livid lightning flashing in the van, roll out from over the wall of the great crater above; then with that malevolence peculiar to the tornado it sees all the soldiers and their wives and children sitting happily in the barrack yard, howling in a minor key and beating their beloved tom-toms, so it comes and sits flump down on them with deluges of water, and sends its lightning running over the ground in livid streams of living death. Oh, they are nice things are tornadoes! I wonder what they will be like when we are up in their home; up atop of that precious wall? I had no idea Mungo was so steep. If I had — well, I am in for it now!</span></p>
<p><span>The Internet War rages on and on and on..... Until Ambazonia is FREE of La Republique du Cameroun illegal landlords! The right to self-determination is non-negotiable. It is inalienable. This right to sovereignty was bestowed on the Southern Cameroons as Mandated Territory of the UN Trust Territory with International legal rights. The Trusteeship Agreement and the General Assembly Declaration Granting Independence granted those rights to All Colonial and Other Territories. The failure to produce a National Constitution for a United Kamerun Federation (Confederation) " before October 1, 1961" as per the terms of UN Resolution 1608 of April 21, 1961, which approved the results of the said UN Plebiscite of February 11, 1961, constituted Material Breach of an International Treaty by Cameroun Republic, one of two parties in the Union. Consequently everything that has been done in the name of unity of Ambazonia and Cameroun Republic is now null and void ab initio - from July 1961 till date. Cameroun must be compelled to evacuate the Ambazonia national territory now and as peacefully as possible. A liberation war will only constitute a greater threat to the security of the entire Gulf of Guinea and the Sub-region.</span></p>

<p><span>(GEOGRAPHY: CA #10 N, 8 E; high peaks; with 4 volcanic islands off the coast [Fernando Po with Clarence Harbor, Ilha da Princa [or Prince's Island], San Tome [or Saint Thomas], and Annobon)</span></p>

<p><span>The struggles between the Bell (Mbeli) and Akwa families were also largely composed. In 1858, on the expulsion of the Baptists from Fernando P0 (q.v.), Saker founded at Ambas Bay a colony of the freed negroes who then left the island, the settlement being known as Victoria. Two years after this event the first German factory was established in the estuary by Messrs. Woermann of Hamburg. In 1870 the station at Bimbia was given up by the missionaries, but that at Akwa town continued to flourish, the Duala showing themselves eager to acquire education, while Saker reduced their language to writing. He left Cameroon in 1876, the year before George Grenfell, afterwards famous for his work on the Congo, came to the country, where he remained three years. Like the earlier missionaries he explored the adjacent districts, discovering the Sanaga in its lower course. Although British influence was powerful and the British consul for the Oil Rivers during this period exercised considerable authority over the native chiefs, requests made by them in particular by the Duala chiefs in 1882 for annexation by Great Britain, were refused or neglected, with the result that when Germany started on her quest to pick up inappropriate parts of the African coast she was enabled to secure Cameroon. A treaty with King Bell was negotiated by Dr Gustav Nachtigal, the signature of the king and the other chiefs being obtained at midnight on the 15th of July 1884. Five days later Mr. E. H. Hewett, British consul, arrived with a mission to annex the country to Great Britain. Though too late to secure King Bells territory, Mr. Hewett concluded treaties with all the neighboring chiefs, but the British government decided to recognize the German claim not only to Bell town, but to the whole Cameroon region. Some of the tribes, disappointed at not being taken over by Great Britain, refused to acknowledge German sovereignty. Their villages were bombarded and they were reduced to submission. The settlement of the English Baptists at Victoria, Ambas Bay, was at first excluded from the German protectorate, but in March 1887 an arrangement was made by which, while the private rights of the missionaries were maintained, the sovereignty of the settlement passed to Germany. The Baptist Society thereafter made over its missions, both at Ambas Bay and in the estuary, to the Basel Society.</span></p>

<li><span>Territorial Disputes: ICJ ruled in 2002 on the entire Cameroon-Nigeria land and maritime boundary but the parties formed a Joint Border Commission to resolve differences bilaterally and have commenced with demarcation in less-contested sections of the boundary, starting in Lake Chad in the north; the ICF ruled on an equidistant settlement of Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, however, implementation of the decision is delayed due to imprecisely defined coordinates, the unresolved Bakassi allocation, and a sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an island at the mouth of the Ntem River; Nigeria initially rejected cession of the Bakassi Peninsula; Lake Chad Commission continues to urge signatories Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria to ratify delimitation treaty over the lake region, which remains the site of armed clashes among local populations and militias.</span></li>
<li><span>The Republic of Ambazonia now wants separation and restoration of their sovereignty as distinct nation from Cameroun. The matter has been taken to all domestic and international courts--from Yaounde Cameroun Military Tribunal Case in 1986, Bamenda, Cameroun High Court in Ambazonia Vrs. Cameroun in 1990-1992, to International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1994, 1997-2003, Abuja, Nigeria High Court in 2002/3/4, Geneva Human Rights Court in 2001-Present, Banjul, Gambia, African Human Rights Court in 2004 to present, all cases to dispute Cameroun claims of union with Ambazonia!</span></li>

<p><span>ALUTA! ALUTA! ALUTA! CONTINUA!!!!</span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span>Dear Dr Gumne, <br /></span></p>
<p><span>It is gratifying to read your disclaimer (on more than one occasion) that SCAPO is in no way associated with the invectives and wild ranting of the anti-Ambazonia SCYL gangsters. <br /><br />Everyone knows that Yaoundé detests Ambazonia simply because the name Ambazonia alone makes Biya guilty of external aggression which in turn makes Cameroon guilty of posing a serious threat to international peace and security. </span></p>
