			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment. Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself. Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude. Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.</p>
