He later became Vice President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1990, profoundly disillusioned by Yaoundé's systematic dismantlement of Anglophone institutions, Foncha publicly resigned from the ruling CPDM party and wrote a historic letter to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights condemning the marginalisation of Anglophone Cameroonians. His repudiation of the federal arrangement he had brokered is cited as powerful evidence that the 1961 compact was subsequently betrayed.",

His Kamerun National Congress (KNC) lost the 1959 general elections to John Foncha's KNDP, which had campaigned for reunification with the Cameroon Republic. Endeley's arguments about the distinct political identity of the Southern Cameroons remain foundational to the Ambazonian legal case.",

He was subsequently arrested and imprisoned for his advocacy. His constitutional argument — that the abolition of the federation was void and that the Southern Cameroons retained its legal personality — became the foundational legal theory of the Ambazonian restoration movement and underpins the Interim Government's claim to sovereignty.",
